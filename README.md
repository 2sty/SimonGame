Simple memory game. 
Instructions:
The board has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it's pressed. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.
